This emerging movement, known as Decentralized Science (DeSci), aims to solve some of the most occurring problems in traditional research systems—limited funding, restricted access, and lack of transparency—by leveraging decentralized networks and token-based economies.', 'Decentralized Science (DeSci) uses blockchain to democratize research, boost transparency, and foster global scientific collaboration. Although DeSci offers several novel solutions to challenges in the scientific research process, it also comes with several challenges and limitations. DeSci solutions must be compliant with established rules around data privacy and sharing to gain adoption among the scientific research community. Therefore, DeSci projects need to address how their solution fits into real-world scenarios that arise in the process of scientific research. Decentralized science or DeSci describes projects and platforms that use blockchain in scientific research. DeSci aims to address legacy challenges, including barriers to funding, data sharing, and research accessibility, among others. Solutions emerging from DeSci include funding DAOs, on-chain knowledge platforms, and NFTs representing intellectual property.', 'The Decentralized Science Lab (dSL) at Kennesaw State University is a research group performing cutting-edge research into decentralized computing concepts and their enabling technologies to provide R&D solutions in multidisciplinary domains including AI, Federated Machine Learning, FinTech, Security, and more.', 'DeSci Leading Projects. Several groundbreaking projects are pushing the decentralized science movement forward: VitaDAO: Aims to advance research on longevity and cancer through community-funded initiatives. GenomicDAO: Leverages AI to increase diversity in genetic research.; OceanDAO: Promotes ethical data usage in scientific endeavors. Research Hub: A decentralized platform that encourages', 'Introduction. Decentralized science or DeSci allows for more diverse funding sources (from DAOs, quadratic donations to crowdfunding and more), more accessible access data and methods, and by providing incentives for reproducibility. Decentralized science addresses real-world issues in scientific research, such as the difficulties of sharing data and discoveries, the slow pace of peer review', 'By using blockchain technology and decentralized networks, DeSci makes research more accessible, transparent, and collaborative. Decentralized Science, commonly called DeSci, is a movement that aims to redefine how scientific research is conducted, shared, and funded by leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Decentralized Science (DeSci) is a movement that leverages blockchain technology and decentralized networks to improve how scientific research is funded, shared, and validated. It replaces traditional systems with transparent, community-driven models, enabling open access to research data, incentivized peer reviews, and equitable funding mechanisms. How Does Decentralized Science (DeSci) Improve Research Funding? DeSci transforms research funding by using decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and blockchain-based tools like quadratic funding.', 'Decentralized Science (DeSci) is revolutionizing the way we approach scientific research by addressing the limitations of traditional, centralized systems. DeSci challenges this model by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies to decentralize funding, execution, and dissemination, creating a more transparent and inclusive research environment. Decentralized participation and governance are interconnected aspects of DeSci. Platforms like Codatta facilitate collaborative data sourcing, allowing individuals to contribute knowledge in the format of frontier data while sharing both risks and benefits. Decentralized science (DeSci) reshapes the entire research process, from funding to dissemination, by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies. With DeSci, research proposals are put forward for funding through decentralized backers, where community-driven contributions play a major role. AI democratizes data analysis, open-source platforms foster collaboration, and Web3 enables decentralized funding through community-driven networks.', 'The Impact of Decentralized Science on Research and Development. Decentralized science has the potential to revolutionize the research and development landscape. By embracing the principles of DeSci, researchers can expect significant benefits in their work. Accelerating Scientific Discoveries with DeSci', \"DeSci (Decentralized Science) addresses the inefficiencies of traditional scientific research by bringing science onchain. Whether it's submitting new research or conducting peer reviews, scientists are compensated for their efforts, aligning their contributions with financial incentives. This model bypasses traditional systems that rely on unpaid peer reviews and merely reputational incentives empowering researchers to take ownership of their work while ensuring that quality contributions are financially rewarded. By offering financial rewards directly tied to the quality and reproducibility of research, platforms like ResearchHub and Molecule foster a model where innovation and real-world outcomes take precedence. With decentralized platforms driving research funding, peer review, and intellectual property management, the scientific process can evolve beyond its current limitations.\"]\n",
